# EncounterRPG
Use excel file as an encounter table and display an encounter depending of it frequency

In this project, you will find only two major tools : ExcelReader and EncounterManager.

The first one allows you to read cells from a workbook by compiling different functions (open/read workbook, read cell value, etc)

The second one will use a sheet to create an encounter map (that represents an encounter table, like in RPG)
